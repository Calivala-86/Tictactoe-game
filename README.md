# Tictactoe-game

This is a simple Tic-tac-toe game application using Java. The game consists of noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, and played by two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
